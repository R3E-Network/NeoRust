# neo-rs

neo-rs is an integral component of our initiative to introduce Rust to the Neo ecosystem. neo-rs is currently in an
active development phase.

# Usage

```rust
 use NeoRust::prelude::*;

We will leverage neo-rs for the creation of various projects, including a `TEE-secured Neo wallet`,
a `Secure Neo node`, `Neo middleware`, `Neo-ZK rollup` solutions, and more.
