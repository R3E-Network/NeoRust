# Getting Started with Neo Rust SDK

The Neo Rust SDK provides a comprehensive set of tools for building applications on the Neo N3 blockchain ecosystem.

## Installation

Add the Neo Rust SDK to your Cargo.toml file:

```toml
[dependencies]
neo3 = "0.1.9"
```

## Basic Usage

Here's a simple example of using the Neo Rust SDK to create a wallet:

```rust
use neo3::prelude::*;

fn main() -> Result<()> {
    // Create a new wallet
    let wallet = Wallet::new();
    
    // Print the wallet address
    println!("New wallet address: {}", wallet.address());
    
    Ok(())
}
```
