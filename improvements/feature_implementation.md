# Feature Organization Implementation Details

This document outlines the implementation details of the feature organization improvements for the NeoRust SDK.

## Implementation Summary

The feature organization has been implemented through the following changes:

1. **Restructured Cargo.toml**: The dependencies have been reorganized with a comprehensive feature flag system
2. **Updated lib.rs**: The main module exports now use conditional compilation based on features
3. **Feature Documentation**: Added feature flag documentation to the README.md
4. **Module-Level Feature Gates**: Added conditional compilation to module files

## 1. Cargo.toml Changes

The updated Cargo.toml file now organizes dependencies into logical groups and makes most dependencies optional, controlled through feature flags. Key changes include:

- Created a hierarchy of features with clear dependencies
- Made most dependencies optional and explicitly enabled through features
- Organized features into functional groups (wallet, transaction, contract, etc.)
- Preserved backward compatibility for existing features like "futures" and "ledger"

## 2. lib.rs Changes

The lib.rs file was updated to use conditional compilation for module exports:

```rust
// Core modules - always available
pub mod neo_error;
pub mod neo_utils;
pub mod neo_types;

// Conditional modules based on features
#[cfg(feature = "crypto-standard")]
#[cfg_attr(docsrs, doc(cfg(feature = "crypto-standard")))]
pub mod neo_crypto;

#[cfg(feature = "transaction")]
#[cfg_attr(docsrs, doc(cfg(feature = "transaction")))]
pub mod neo_builder;

// ...more conditional modules...
```

The re-exports and prelude imports were also updated to use feature flags:

```rust
#[doc(inline)]
#[cfg(feature = "transaction")]
pub use neo_builder as builder;

// ...more conditional re-exports...

pub mod prelude {
    // Core types and utilities - always available
    pub use super::neo_error::*;
    pub use super::neo_types::*;
    
    // Conditional imports based on features
    #[cfg(feature = "transaction")]
    pub use super::builder::*;
    
    // ...more conditional imports...
}
```

## 3. Module-Level Feature Gates

Individual modules were updated to conditionally compile submodules based on features. For example, in `neo_crypto/mod.rs`:

```rust
// Core crypto functionality - available with crypto-standard feature
pub use error::*;
pub use hash::*;
pub use key_pair::*;

// Additional functionality available with crypto-advanced feature
#[cfg(feature = "crypto-advanced")]
#[cfg_attr(docsrs, doc(cfg(feature = "crypto-advanced")))]
pub use utils::*;

// Core crypto modules - always available with crypto-standard
mod error;
mod hash;
mod key_pair;

// Advanced crypto modules - only available with crypto-advanced feature
#[cfg(feature = "crypto-advanced")]
mod utils;
```

## 4. Documentation Updates

The feature flags were documented in:

1. **README.md**: Added a comprehensive "Feature Flags" section
2. **lib.rs**: Added feature flag documentation in the crate root documentation
3. **Module documentation**: Added feature flag documentation to module-level doc comments

## Testing Approach

To ensure the feature organization works correctly, the following tests should be performed:

1. **Build with minimal features**: `cargo build --no-default-features --features="transaction"`
2. **Build with common combinations**: `cargo build --features="wallet,http-client"`
3. **Build with all features**: `cargo build --all-features`
4. **Run tests with specific features**: `cargo test --features="transaction,crypto-standard"`

## Backward Compatibility Considerations

To maintain backward compatibility, the following measures were taken:

1. **Legacy feature aliases**: The "futures" feature was kept as an alias for "async-std"
2. **Default features**: The default features include the most commonly used functionality
3. **Feature dependencies**: Features automatically enable their dependencies

## Results and Benefits

The feature organization implementation provides the following benefits:

1. **Smaller binaries**: Applications only include what they need
2. **Faster compile times**: Building with minimal features reduces compilation time
3. **Clearer dependencies**: Feature groups make it obvious which dependencies are needed
4. **Modular design**: Features can be easily combined for specific use cases

## Next Steps

To fully complete the feature organization improvements, the following steps are recommended:

1. **Update all modules**: Apply conditional compilation to more modules based on features
2. **Add feature tests**: Create CI tests for different feature combinations
3. **Update examples**: Create examples that demonstrate minimal feature usage
4. **Documentation refinement**: Add more detailed feature combination recommendations
5. **Performance benchmarks**: Measure the impact on compile times and binary sizes
