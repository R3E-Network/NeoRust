2. **Neo N3 Documentation Enhancement**
   - Develop protocol reference documentation
   - Create detailed examples for Neo N3 specific features
   - Improve API documentation with Neo N3 concepts
   - Expected outcome: Better developer onboarding and understanding

### Phase 2: Core Functionality (Months 2-4)

3. **NEP-17/NEP-11 Token Standard Enhancements**
   - Implement enhanced traits for token standards
   - Create token amount handling with decimal awareness
   - Add NFT metadata support
   - Develop utility functions for common token operations
   - Expected outcome: Comprehensive token standard support

4. **WASM Optimization - Foundation**
   - Implement WASM-specific feature flags
   - Create initial size optimizations
   - Develop TypeScript type definitions
   - Expected outcome: Initial WASM improvements with better TypeScript integration

### Phase 3: Advanced Improvements (Months 4-6)

5. **WASM Optimization - Advanced**
   - Implement browser-native crypto integrations
   - Add browser storage and event capabilities
   - Create example applications
   - Expected outcome: Fully optimized WASM support

6. **SGX Modularization**
   - Define enclave interface traits
   - Move SGX implementations to separate crate
   - Update documentation and examples
   - Expected outcome: Modular SGX support with cleaner interfaces

## Implementation Approach

### Feature Organization Pull Request

**Branch name**: `feature/improved-feature-flags`

**Key files to modify**:
- `Cargo.toml` - Update feature definitions
- `README.md` - Update feature documentation
- Various source files - Update cfg attributes

**Test plan**:
- Build with various feature combinations
- Measure compile times and binary sizes
- Verify all functionality works with new feature structure

### Neo N3 Documentation Pull Request

**Branch name**: `docs/neo-n3-protocol-reference`

**Key files to create/modify**:
- `docs/neo-n3-protocol.md` - New protocol reference
- `docs/examples/` - New example directory with Neo N3 examples
- Source file documentation - Add Neo N3 concept references

**Test plan**:
- Review documentation for clarity and completeness
- Test code examples to ensure they work
- Get feedback from team members unfamiliar with Neo N3

### NEP-17/NEP-11 Enhancements Pull Request

**Branch name**: `feature/enhanced-token-standards`

**Key files to create/modify**:
- `src/token/nep17.rs` - Enhanced NEP-17 implementation
- `src/token/nep11.rs` - New/enhanced NEP-11 implementation
- `src/token/amount.rs` - New token amount handling
- `src/token/metadata.rs` - New NFT metadata handling

**Test plan**:
- Unit tests for all new functionality
- Integration tests with test tokens
- Benchmarks for token operations

### WASM Optimization Pull Requests

**Branch name**: `feature/wasm-optimization-phase1`

**Key files to create/modify**:
- `Cargo.toml` - Add WASM-specific features
- `src/wasm/` - New directory for WASM-specific code
- `.github/workflows/wasm.yml` - New CI workflow for WASM

**Test plan**:
- Measure WASM bundle size before and after
- Test in multiple browsers
- Benchmark key operations

### SGX Modularization Pull Request

**Branch name**: `feature/sgx-modularization`

**Key files to create/modify**:
- `Cargo.toml` - Update SGX dependencies
- `src/enclave/traits.rs` - New interface traits
- Create new crate `neo3-sgx/` - Move SGX implementations

**Test plan**:
- Verify core SDK works without SGX
- Test SGX functionality with new crate
- Ensure backward compatibility

## Resources and Dependencies

### External Dependencies

- Rust nightly updates
- Neo N3 protocol updates
- SGX SDK compatibility
- Browser WASM support changes

### Internal Dependencies

- Feature organization should be completed before other improvements
- SGX modularization requires feature organization to be complete
- WASM optimization can proceed in parallel with token standard enhancements

### Tools and Resources

- Benchmark suite for measuring improvements
- Documentation build system
- WASM build and test environment
- SGX development environment

## Risk Management

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Breaking changes | Medium | High | Maintain compatibility layer, version appropriately |
| Increased maintenance burden | Low | Medium | Document maintenance procedures, automation |
| Implementation delays | Medium | Medium | Prioritize based on user feedback, incremental approach |
| Browser compatibility issues | Medium | Medium | Comprehensive browser testing matrix |

## Success Criteria

1. **Feature Organization**: Compile time reduced by 30%, binary size reduced by 20%
2. **Documentation**: Positive feedback from new Neo developers
3. **Token Standards**: Successfully interact with standard NEP-17/NEP-11 tokens
4. **WASM**: 40% smaller bundle size, 2x faster key operations
5. **SGX**: Clean separation with no functionality loss

## Next Steps

1. Begin with Feature Organization pull request
2. Initiate documentation improvements in parallel
3. Set up measurement infrastructure for benchmarking
4. Create detailed specifications for each improvement area
5. Establish regular progress review checkpoints

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to improving the NeoRust SDK. By following this sequence, we can deliver incremental value while managing dependencies between different improvement areas. Each phase builds on the previous one, ensuring a coherent evolution of the SDK.

The plan balances technical complexity with business impact to prioritize the most valuable improvements first. Regular review checkpoints will allow for adjustments based on feedback and changing requirements.
