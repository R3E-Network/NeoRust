   - Added feature flags for transaction signing capabilities
   - Updated tests to use feature flags

6. **Protocol Module** (`src/neo_protocol/mod.rs`):
   - Organized core protocol errors to be always available
   - Added conditional compilation for account management and NEP-2 functionality
   - Made RPC response types conditional on the http-client feature
   - Added feature gates for role-based access control

7. **Builder Module** (`src/neo_builder/mod.rs`):
   - Added feature flags for contract invocation and deployment
   - Made core transaction building available with the transaction feature
   - Added conditional modules for specific building operations
   - Enhanced documentation with feature requirements

8. **Types Module** (`src/neo_types/mod.rs`):
   - Implemented a comprehensive feature flag system for all types
   - Made core types (like ScriptHash and Address) always available
   - Added conditional compilation for contract-related types
   - Made serialization helpers conditional on the serde feature
   - Added feature gates for wallet-specific types (like ScryptParams)

9. **Codec Module** (`src/neo_codec/mod.rs`):
   - Separated core encoding functionality from format-specific implementations
   - Added conditional compilation for binary encoding based on binary-format feature
   - Created a new JSON codec module conditional on the serde feature
   - Enhanced documentation to explain feature dependencies

10. **Config Module** (`src/neo_config/mod.rs`):
    - Made core constants always available
    - Added conditional compilation for network configuration based on client features
    - Limited test configuration to test mode only
    - Added comprehensive feature documentation

11. **Utils Module** (`src/neo_utils/mod.rs`):
    - Updated documentation to clarify core utilities
    - Simplified the module structure to focus on error handling

12. **Neo X Module** (`src/neo_x/mod.rs`):
    - Made EVM functionality conditional on ethereum-compat and http-client features
    - Made bridge functionality conditional on contract feature
    - Added clear feature requirements in documentation
    - Enhanced module-level documentation

13. **SGX Module** (`src/neo_sgx/mod.rs`):
    - Added more granular feature flags for SGX functionality
    - Made crypto extensions conditional on crypto-advanced feature
    - Made secure wallet functionality conditional on wallet-secure feature
    - Added comprehensive feature documentation

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Clearer Module Boundaries**:
   - Each module now has a clear separation between core functionality and optional features
   - Dependencies are properly scoped to the features that need them

2. **Better Documentation**:
   - Added feature flag documentation to all modified modules
   - Clarified which functionality requires specific features
   - Improved module-level documentation

3. **Optimized Conditional Compilation**:
   - Used `#[cfg(feature = "...")]` consistently throughout the codebase
   - Applied `#[cfg_attr(docsrs, doc(cfg(feature = "...")))]` for documentation
   - Ensured test-only code is properly gated

4. **Reduced Dependency Scope**:
   - Made heavy dependencies (like serialization libraries) optional
   - Limited cryptographic operations to crypto features
   - Ensured network-related code only appears in relevant features

## Next Steps

To complete the implementation of the feature flag system, we should:

1. **Update Tests**:
   - Add features to test modules to ensure they only run when the required features are enabled
   - Create test cases that verify functionality works with different feature combinations

2. **Update Examples**:
   - Ensure examples specify the minimum required features
   - Create examples demonstrating different feature combinations

3. **CI Integration**:
   - Add CI jobs to test building with various feature combinations
   - Ensure documentation is built with all features for comprehensive API docs

4. **Performance Measurements**:
   - Measure compile times with different feature combinations
   - Measure binary sizes with different feature combinations
   - Document the performance improvements

5. **Final Documentation Update**:
   - Update the README with comprehensive feature flag documentation
   - Create a migration guide for users of previous versions
   - Document common feature combinations for different use cases

## Conclusion

The implementation of the feature flag system is now largely complete. We have successfully applied the pattern to all major modules of the SDK and have established a clear and consistent approach to feature management. The changes have already significantly improved the organization and maintainability of the codebase.

The feature flags now provide a clear separation of concerns, allowing users to include only the functionality they need. This will lead to faster compile times, smaller binaries, and a more maintainable codebase. By completing the remaining next steps, we can finalize the implementation and provide users with a more flexible, efficient, and maintainable SDK.
