# Estimated Performance Impact of Feature Organization

This document provides estimates of the performance improvements expected from the feature organization changes.

## Compile Time Impact

The following table shows estimated compile times for different feature combinations:

| Feature Combination | Estimated Compile Time | % Reduction from Full Build |
|---------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|
| All features | 2m 15s | 0% (baseline) |
| Default features | 1m 45s | 22% |
| wallet + transaction | 1m 5s | 52% |
| wallet only | 38s | 72% |
| http-client only | 42s | 69% |
| contract only | 55s | 59% |
| Minimal (core types only) | 25s | 81% |

*Note: These are estimates based on typical Rust project compilation patterns. Actual times will vary based on hardware, compiler version, and other factors.*

## Binary Size Impact

The following table shows estimated binary sizes for different feature combinations:

| Feature Combination | Estimated Binary Size | % Reduction from Full Build |
|---------------------|----------------------|----------------------------|
| All features | 8.2 MB | 0% (baseline) |
| Default features | 6.5 MB | 21% |
| wallet + transaction | 2.3 MB | 72% |
| wallet only | 1.1 MB | 87% |
| http-client only | 1.5 MB | 82% |
| contract only | 1.8 MB | 78% |
| Minimal (core types only) | 0.7 MB | 91% |

*Note: These are estimates. Actual binary sizes will vary based on build configuration, optimization levels, and other factors.*

## Dependency Impact

The feature organization will also reduce the number of dependencies pulled in for minimal builds:

| Feature Combination | Est. # of Direct Dependencies | Est. # of Transitive Dependencies |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| All features | 35+ | 150+ |
| Default features | 25+ | 120+ |
| wallet + transaction | 15+ | 75+ |
| wallet only | 10+ | 50+ |
| http-client only | 12+ | 60+ |
| contract only | 14+ | 70+ |
| Minimal (core types only) | 5+ | 25+ |

## Developer Experience Impact

### Local Development

- **Incremental Builds**: Faster incremental builds due to fewer dependencies
- **IDE Experience**: Improved code completion and analysis performance
- **Testing**: Faster test runs when running tests for specific modules

### CI/CD Pipeline

- **PR Checks**: Faster PR verification with minimal feature builds
- **Matrix Testing**: Ability to test different feature combinations in parallel
- **Documentation**: Faster docs generation with conditional feature documentation

## Real-World Scenarios

### Mobile App Integration

For a mobile app integrating NeoRust through FFI:
- Compile time reduced from 2m 15s to ~50s (78% reduction)
- Binary size reduced from 8.2MB to ~1.5MB (82% reduction)
- Fewer dependencies to manage and troubleshoot

### Web dApp (WASM)

For a web application using NeoRust compiled to WebAssembly:
- WASM bundle size reduced from ~2MB to ~600KB (70% reduction)
- Faster page load times due to smaller WASM bundle
- Reduced memory usage in browser

### Simple CLI Tool

For a command-line wallet management tool:
- Binary size reduced from 8.2MB to ~1.1MB (87% reduction)
- Startup time improved due to smaller binary
- Fewer dependencies to maintain

## Long-term Benefits

- **Easier Maintenance**: Clearer boundaries between components makes maintenance easier
- **Better Testing**: More focused test suites for specific features
- **Improved Onboarding**: Developers can start with minimal features and add as needed
- **Future Extensibility**: New features can be added more easily as optional components

## Measurement Methodology

To verify these estimates after implementation, we recommend:
1. Using `cargo build --timings` to measure compile times
2. Using `ls -lh target/release/libneo3.rlib` to measure binary sizes
3. Using `cargo tree` to count dependencies
4. Creating benchmark applications for each common use case
