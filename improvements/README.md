## Getting Started

If you're new to these improvement plans, we recommend starting with:

1. First, review the [Executive Summary](executive_summary.md) for a high-level overview
2. Then, look at the [Implementation Action Plan](implementation_action_plan.md) to understand the proposed sequence
3. Finally, dive into specific improvement documents based on your area of interest

## Priority Areas

Based on our assessment, the improvement priorities are:

1. **Feature Organization** - Reorganizing dependencies with a comprehensive feature flag system
2. **Neo N3 Documentation** - Enhancing protocol documentation and examples
3. **WASM Optimization** - Improving WebAssembly support for web applications
4. **NEP-17/NEP-11 Enhancement** - Comprehensive support for token standards
5. **SGX Modularization** - Refactoring SGX integration into a separate crate

## Implementation Guidance

Each document provides detailed implementation guidance, including:

- Current state analysis
- Proposed solutions
- Code examples where applicable
- Testing approaches
- Migration paths for existing users
