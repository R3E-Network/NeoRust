/// Errors that may occur within wallet operations.
///
/// This enum encompasses a range of errors that can arise when interacting with
/// cryptocurrency wallets, including but not limited to account state issues, cryptographic
/// errors, and IO operations. It is designed to be comprehensive, covering errors
/// from underlying libraries (such as ECDSA operations, hex encoding/decoding) as well
/// as wallet-specific errors like missing key pairs or default accounts.
///
/// # Variants
///
/// - `AccountState`: Represents errors related to an account's state, such as when an account
///   cannot be found or is in an invalid state for the requested operation.
/// - `NoKeyPair`: Indicates that a key pair was expected but none was found.
/// - `EcdsaError`: Wraps errors from the `ecdsa` crate, typically related to signature operations.
/// - `HexError`: Wraps errors from the `hex` crate, often arising during hex encoding or decoding.
/// - `IoError`: Wraps standard IO errors that might occur during file operations.
/// - `NoDefaultAccount`: Signals that a default account was expected but not set.
/// - `InvalidKeyPair`: General error for when a key pair is invalid or fails validation.
/// - `CryptoError`: Wraps cryptographic errors, potentially from operations like hashing or encryption.
/// - `TransactionError`: Encapsulates errors that may occur during transaction creation or processing.
/// - `BuilderError`: Wraps errors that occur during the construction of complex objects, possibly due to invalid parameters.
/// - `DecryptionError`: Indicates an error occurred during account decryption.
/// - `SigningError`: Indicates an error occurred during transaction signing.
/// - `FileError`: Indicates an error occurred during file operations.
/// - `ParseError`: Indicates an error occurred during parsing operations.
/// - `ImportError`: Indicates an error occurred during key import operations.
/// - `InvalidPassword`: Indicates that an invalid password was provided.
/// - `NoAccounts`: Indicates that no accounts were found in the wallet.
/// - `YubiHsmError`: Wraps errors related to YubiHSM operations.
/// - `ProviderError`: Wraps errors from the RPC provider.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Handling a `WalletError` might look like this:
///
/// ```
/// # use NeoRust::prelude::WalletError;
/// # fn main() -> Result<(), WalletError> {
/// let result = some_wallet_operation();
///     match result {
///         Ok(_) => println!("Operation successful"),
///         Err(WalletError::NoKeyPair) => println!("Key pair missing"),
///         Err(e) => println!("An error occurred: {:?}", e),
///     }
/// #    Ok(())
/// # }
/// # fn some_wallet_operation() -> Result<(), WalletError> {
/// #    Err(WalletError::NoKeyPair)
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// This approach allows for precise error handling and reporting, facilitating debugging and user feedback.
