# NeoRust SDK Feature Status - Updated

## Working Features

1. **std**: Standard library support - ✅ Works correctly
2. **crypto-standard**: Core cryptographic functionality - ✅ Works correctly
3. **wallet**: Basic wallet functionality - ✅ Fixed circular dependencies, error handling, and module visibility issues
4. **http-client**: HTTP client for JSON-RPC communication - ✅ Works when combined with tokio and ethereum-compat features
5. **rest-client**: REST API client for Neo N3 nodes - ✅ Working properly
6. **websocket**: WebSocket client for real-time updates - ✅ Works correctly with dependencies

## Features with Issues

1. **wallet-standard**: Extended wallet functionality - ❌ Has import and dependency issues including:
   - Missing wasm_bindgen dependency
   - Mismatches between AccountTrait implementations
   - Multiple field and method access issues

2. **transaction**: Transaction creation and signing - ❌ Multiple issues:
   - Dependency issues (requires contract feature for some functionality)
   - Missing imports and type definitions
   - Circular dependencies with other modules

3. **contract**: Smart contract functionality - ❌ Not tested, likely has issues

## Required Fixes

### For wallet-standard:
- Fix imports in nep6account.rs
- Add proper field mappings between Account and NEP6Account
- Fix the error type conversion

### For transaction:
- Add proper feature gates for dependencies
- Fix circular dependencies
- Restructure code to avoid complex dependencies

### For http-client:
- Make tokio a required dependency when http-client is enabled
- Fix error type conversions

## Next Steps

1. Address issues with wallet-standard feature
2. Fix transaction feature and its dependencies
3. Fix contract feature
4. Add more comprehensive tests for each feature
5. Improve documentation for feature usage
