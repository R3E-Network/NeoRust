/// This example demonstrates the concept of deploying a smart contract to the Neo N3 blockchain.

/// In a real application, you would:
/// 1. Connect to a Neo N3 node
/// 2. Load your account private key
/// 3. Create or load the NEF file containing the compiled contract
/// 4. Create or load the contract manifest
/// 5. Deploy the contract using ContractManagement
/// 6. Sign and send the transaction
/// 7. Wait for the transaction to be confirmed
