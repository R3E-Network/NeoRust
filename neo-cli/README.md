## Overview

Neo CLI provides a comprehensive set of tools for interacting with the Neo blockchain ecosystem. It allows developers and users to manage wallets, interact with smart contracts, monitor blockchain state, configure network connections, engage with DeFi applications and well-known contracts, and leverage NeoFS decentralized storage.

## Features

- **Wallet Management**: Create, open, and manage Neo wallets, including key manipulation and asset transfers
- **Blockchain Operations**: Query blockchain state, blocks, transactions and more
- **Network Configuration**: Connect to different Neo networks and manage node connections
- **Smart Contract Interactions**: Deploy, invoke, and analyze smart contracts
- **DeFi Integrations**: Interact with Neo-based DeFi platforms, protocols, and well-known contracts
- **NeoFS Integration**: Store and retrieve data from Neo's decentralized storage

## Installation

### From Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/r3-network/neo-rust.git
cd neo-rust

# Build the CLI tool
cargo build --release -p neo-cli

# Run the CLI
./target/release/neo-cli --help
```

### Using Cargo

```bash
cargo install neo-cli
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize configuration
neo-cli init

# Create a new wallet
neo-cli wallet create --name my-wallet

# Check wallet balance
neo-cli wallet balance --name my-wallet

# Get blockchain height
neo-cli blockchain height

# Deploy a smart contract
neo-cli contract deploy --path ./my-contract.nef --manifest ./my-contract.manifest.json

# List famous contracts on mainnet
neo-cli defi list --network mainnet

# Check NeoFS connection status
neo-cli fs status
```

# Show details for Flamingo Finance contract
neo-cli defi show "Flamingo Finance"

# Invoke a method on a contract
neo-cli defi invoke ghostmarket "balanceOf" --args '[{"type":"Address","value":"NZKvXidwBhnV8rNXh2eXtpm5bH1rkofaDz"}]'

# Check token balance
neo-cli defi balance "FLM Token" --address NZKvXidwBhnV8rNXh2eXtpm5bH1rkofaDz

# Perform a token swap
neo-cli defi swap --token-from NEO --token-to GAS --amount 1
```

### NeoFS Commands

- `neo-cli fs container`: Create, list, get info, and delete containers
- `neo-cli fs object`: Upload, download, delete objects
- `neo-cli fs acl`: Manage access control for containers and objects
- `neo-cli fs endpoints`: Manage and get information about NeoFS endpoints
- `neo-cli fs status`: Show NeoFS connection status

```bash
# List all available NeoFS endpoints for mainnet
neo-cli fs endpoints list --network mainnet

# Test connection to a specific endpoint
neo-cli fs endpoints test --endpoint grpc.mainnet.fs.neo.org:8082

# Get detailed information about an endpoint
neo-cli fs endpoints info --endpoint grpc.mainnet.fs.neo.org:8082

# Create a container
neo-cli fs container create --config container-config.json

# Upload a file
neo-cli fs object put --container CID --file path/to/file

# Download a file
neo-cli fs object get --container CID --id OID --output path/to/save
```

## Configuration

Neo CLI uses a configuration file to store settings like network preferences, RPC endpoints, and more. You can initialize the configuration with:

```bash
neo-cli init [--path /custom/path/config.json]
```

The default location for the configuration file is in your system's config directory under `neo-cli/config.json`.

## Testing

The Neo CLI includes comprehensive automated tests to ensure functionality and help with development.

### Running Tests

To run all tests:

```bash
cargo test
```

To run only specific test categories:

```bash
# Run only DeFi tests (including well-known contracts)
cargo test --test integration_tests integration::defi_tests

# Run only NeoFS tests
cargo test --test integration_tests integration::fs_tests
```

### Test Structure

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and components
- **Integration Tests**: Test the CLI commands from a user perspective
  - `defi_tests.rs`: Tests for DeFi and well-known contract commands
  - `fs_tests.rs`: Tests for NeoFS storage operations
  - `blockchain_tests.rs`: Tests for blockchain query commands
  - `wallet_tests.rs`: Tests for wallet management commands

### Writing New Tests

When adding new features to the CLI, follow this pattern for testing:

1. Create unit tests for new functions in the source files
2. Add integration tests in the appropriate test module
3. Run the tests to verify functionality
4. Ensure both success cases and error handling are tested

## Development

### Building from Source

```bash
cargo build [--release]
```

### Running Tests

```bash
cargo test -p neo-cli
```
